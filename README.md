## Repository Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data engineering training program that covers all aspects of modern data pipeline development. Each directory focuses on specific tools and concepts, building towards a complete end-to-end data engineering solution.

## Directory Structure

### `docker-and-terraform/`
> Learn containerization with Docker, infrastructure as code with Terraform, and cloud services with GCP.

### `orchestration/`
> Master workflow orchestration using Kestra and understand data lake architectures.

### `batch-processing/`
> Develop skills in API integration, data normalization, and scalable pipeline design.

### `data-warehouisng/`
> Explore BigQuery, data partitioning, clustering strategies, and machine learning capabilities.

### `analytics-engineering/`
> Implement analytics engineering with dbt, focusing on testing, documentation, and visualization.

### `stream-processing/`
> Build real-time data pipelines with Kafka, Kafka Streams, and Avro schema management.

## Final Project
